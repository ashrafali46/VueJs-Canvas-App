# mosaic-test

> Image manipulation SPA 

(1)
Development started with a simple quick proof-of-concept prototype focused
on core image-related routines without any additional features and UI. 
The solution is a simple page with vanilla JS and some JQuery.

Prototype's core features:
a) upload and image resizing to fit predefined maximum size
b) mosaic effect generation
c) mosaic upload to Imgur

http://localhost:8080/image-lab.html

Next steps:
a) test cases
b) app UI design
c) vue app creation

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
